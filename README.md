This is a production-ready deep learning pipeline for flood detection from Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. It performs binary semantic segmentation (flooded vs. non-flooded land), outputs explainable masks with calibrated confidence, and generates georeferenced layers for emergency response and climate risk analytics.
